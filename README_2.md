# Name of the project
> Additional information or tagline

A brief description of your project, what it is used for and how does life get
awesome when someone starts to use it.

## Installing / Getting started

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get a hello world up &
running.

```shell
packagemanager install awesome-project
awesome-project start
awesome-project "Do something!"  # prints "Nah."
```

Here you should say what actually happens when you execute the code above.

### Initial Configuration

Some projects require initial configuration (e.g. access tokens or keys, `npm i`).
This is the section where you would document those requirements.

## Developing

Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your/awesome-project.git
cd awesome-project/
packagemanager install
```

And state what happens step-by-step.

### Building

If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build the
project after some code changes, state them here:

```shell
./configure
make
make install
```

Here again you should state what actually happens when the code above gets
executed.

### Deploying / Publishing

In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a
server, this is the right time to state it.

```shell
packagemanager deploy awesome-project -s server.com -u username -p password
```

And again you'd need to tell what the previous code actually does.

## Features

What's all the bells and whistles this project can perform?
* What's the main functionality
* You can also do another thing
* If you get really randy, you can even do this

## Configuration

Here you should write what are all of the configurations a user can enter when
using the project.

#### Argument 1
Type: `String`  
Default: `'default value'`

State what an argument does and how you can use it. If needed, you can provide
an example below.

Example:
```bash
awesome-project "Some other value"  # Prints "You're nailing this readme!"
```

#### Argument 2
Type: `Number|Boolean`  
Default: 100

Copy-paste as many of these as you need.

## Contributing

When you publish something open source, one of the greatest motivations is that
anyone can just jump in and start contributing to your project.

These paragraphs are meant to welcome those kind souls to feel that they are
needed. You should state something like:

"If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and use a feature
branch. Pull requests are warmly welcome."

If there's anything else the developer needs to know (e.g. the code style
guide), you should link it here. If there's a lot of things to take into
consideration, it is common to separate this section to its own file called
`CONTRIBUTING.md` (or similar). If so, you should say that it exists here.

## Links

Even though this information can be found inside the project on machine-readable
format like in a .json file, it's good to include a summary of most useful
links to humans using your project. You can include links like:

- Project homepage: https://your.github.com/awesome-project/
- Repository: https://github.com/your/awesome-project/
- Issue tracker: https://github.com/your/awesome-project/issues
  - In case of sensitive bugs like security vulnerabilities, please contact
    my@email.com directly instead of using issue tracker. We value your effort
    to improve the security and privacy of this project!
- Related projects:
  - Your other project: https://github.com/your/other-project/
  - Someone else's project: https://github.com/someones/awesome-project/


## Licensing

One really important part: Give your project a proper license. Here you should
state what the license is and how to find the text version of the license.
Something like:

<p>This project showcases the use of blockchain in insurance domain for claim processing. In this application, we have four participants, namely insurance, police, repair shop and shop peer. Insurance peer is the insurance company providing the insurance for the products and it is responsible for processing the claims. Police peer is responsible for verifying the theft claims. Repair shop peer is responsible for repairs of the product while shop peer sells the products to consumer.</p>
<p>Audience level : Intermediate Developers</p>

<p>The home page shows the participants (Peers) in the network. You can see that there is an Insurance, Repair Shop, Police and Shop Peer implemented. They are the participants of the network.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="/IBM/build-blockchain-insurance-app/blob/master/images/home.png"><img src="/IBM/build-blockchain-insurance-app/raw/master/images/home.png" alt="Blockchain Insurance" style="max-width:100%;"></a></p>
<p>Imagine being a consumer (hereinafter called “Biker”) that wants to buy a phone, bike or Ski. By clicking on the “Go to the shop” section, you will be redirected to the shop (shop peer) that offers you the following products.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="/IBM/build-blockchain-insurance-app/blob/master/images/Picture1.png"><img src="/IBM/build-blockchain-insurance-app/raw/master/images/Picture1.png" alt="Customer Shopping" style="max-width:100%;"></a></p>
<p>You can see the three products offered by the shop(s) now. In addition, you have insurance contracts available for them. In our scenario, you are an outdoor sport enthusiast who wants to buy a new Bike. Therefore, you’ll click on the Bike Shop section.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="/IBM/build-blockchain-insurance-app/blob/master/images/Picture2.png"><img src="/IBM/build-blockchain-insurance-app/raw/master/images/Picture2.png" alt="Shopping" style="max-width:100%;"></a></p>
<p>In this section, you are viewing the different bikes available in the store. You can select within four different Bikes. By clicking on next you’ll be forwarded to the next page which will ask for the customer’s personal data.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="/IBM/build-blockchain-insurance-app/blob/master/images/Picture3.png"><img src="/IBM/build-blockchain-insurance-app/raw/master/images/Picture3.png" alt="Bike Shop" style="max-width:100%;"></a></p>
<p>You have the choice between different insurance contracts that feature different coverage as well as terms and conditions. You are required to type-in your personal data and select a start and end date of the contract. Since there is a trend of short-term or event-driven contracts in the insurance industry you have the chance to select the duration of the contract on a daily basis. The daily price of the insurance contract is being calculated by a formula that had been defined in the chaincode. By clicking on next you will be forwarded to a screen that summarizes your purchase and shows you the total sum.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="/IBM/build-blockchain-insurance-app/blob/master/images/Picture4.png"><img src="/IBM/build-blockchain-insurance-app/raw/master/images/Picture4.png" alt="Bike Insurance" style="max-width:100%;"></a></p>
<p>The application will show you the total sum of your purchase. By clicking on “order” you agree to the terms and conditions and close the deal (signing of the contract). In addition, you’ll receive a unique username and password. The login credentials will be used once you file a claim.  A block is being written to the Blockchain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>note You can see the block by clicking on the black arrow on the bottom-right.</p>

<p>Once an incident has happened the Biker can file a claim on his own by selecting the “claim Self-Service” tab.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="/IBM/build-blockchain-insurance-app/blob/master/images/Picture61.png"><img src="/IBM/build-blockchain-insurance-app/raw/master/images/Picture61.png" alt="Claim Service" style="max-width:100%;"></a></p>
<p>The Biker will be asked to login by using the credentials that had been given to him before.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="/IBM/build-blockchain-insurance-app/blob/master/images/Picture7.png"><img src="/IBM/build-blockchain-insurance-app/raw/master/images/Picture7.png" alt="Login" style="max-width:100%;"></a></p>
<p>He can file a new claim by selecting the tab shown above.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="/IBM/build-blockchain-insurance-app/blob/master/images/Picture8.png"><img src="/IBM/build-blockchain-insurance-app/raw/master/images/Picture8.png" alt="File Claim" style="max-width:100%;"></a></p>
<p>The Biker can briefly describe the damage on his bike and/or select whether it has been stolen. In case the Bike has been stolen the claim will be processed through the police who has to confirm or deny the theft (option 1). In case there was just a damage the claim will be processed through the repair shop (option 2). In the following section, we will start with option 1.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="/IBM/build-blockchain-insurance-app/blob/master/images/Picture9.png"><img src="/IBM/build-blockchain-insurance-app/raw/master/images/Picture9.png" alt="Claim Description" style="max-width:100%;"></a></p>
<p><strong>Option 1</strong></p>
<p>Once the Biker has submitted the claim it will be shown in the box marked in red. Furthermore, another block is being written to the chain.
<a target="_blank" href="/IBM/build-blockchain-insurance-app/blob/master/images/Picture10.png"><img src="/IBM/build-blockchain-insurance-app/raw/master/images/Picture10.png" alt="Claim Block" style="max-width:100%;"></a></p>
<p>The Biker can also view the active claims. <strong>Note:</strong> You may need to re-log into Claims Processing to see the new active claim.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="/IBM/build-blockchain-insurance-app/blob/master/images/Picture11.png"><img src="/IBM/build-blockchain-insurance-app/raw/master/images/Picture11.png" alt="Active Claims" style="max-width:100%;"></a></p>
<p>By selecting “claim processing” the Insurance company can view all active claims that have not been processed yet. A clerk can decide on the claims in this view. Since we are still looking at option 1 the theft has to be confirmed or denied by the police. Therefore, the insurance company can only reject the claim at this point in stage.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="/IBM/build-blockchain-insurance-app/blob/master/images/Picture12.png"><img src="/IBM/build-blockchain-insurance-app/raw/master/images/Picture12.png" alt="Claim Processing" style="max-width:100%;"></a></p>
<p>The Police Peer can view the claims that include theft. In case the bike has been reported stolen they can confirm the claim and include a file reference number. In case no theft has been reported they can reject the claim and it will not be processed.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="/IBM/build-blockchain-insurance-app/blob/master/images/Picture13.png"><img src="/IBM/build-blockchain-insurance-app/raw/master/images/Picture13.png" alt="Police Peer" style="max-width:100%;"></a></p>
<p>Let’s assume the Biker did not rip-off the insurance company and has reported the bike as stolen. The police will confirm the claim which results in another Block being written to the chain.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="/IBM/build-blockchain-insurance-app/blob/master/images/Picture14.png"><img src="/IBM/build-blockchain-insurance-app/raw/master/images/Picture14.png" alt="Police Transaction" style="max-width:100%;"></a></p>
<p>Going back to the “claim processing” tab you can see that the insurance company has the option to reimburse the claim now because the police had confirmed that the bike has been stolen. Block is being written to the chain</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="/IBM/build-blockchain-insurance-app/blob/master/images/Picture15.png"><img src="/IBM/build-blockchain-insurance-app/raw/master/images/Picture15.png" alt="Claim Processing" style="max-width:100%;"></a></p>
<p>The Biker can see the new status of his claim which changed to reimbursed.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="/IBM/build-blockchain-insurance-app/blob/master/images/Picture16.png"><img src="/IBM/build-blockchain-insurance-app/raw/master/images/Picture16.png" alt="User login" style="max-width:100%;"></a></p>
<p><strong>Option 2</strong></p>
<p>Option 2 covers the case of an accident.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="/IBM/build-blockchain-insurance-app/blob/master/images/Picture17.png"><img src="/IBM/build-blockchain-insurance-app/raw/master/images/Picture17.png" alt="Accident" style="max-width:100%;"></a></p>
<p>The insurance “claim processing” tab shows the unprocessed claims. A clerk can choose between three options on how to process the claim. “Reject” will stop the claim process whereas “reimburse” leads directly to the payment to the customer. In case something needs to be repaired the insurance company has the option to select “repair”. This will forward the claim to a repair shop and will generate a repair order. A block is being written to the chain.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="/IBM/build-blockchain-insurance-app/blob/master/images/Picture18.png"><img src="/IBM/build-blockchain-insurance-app/raw/master/images/Picture18.png" alt="Claim Processing" style="max-width:100%;"></a></p>
<p>The Repair Shop will get a message showing the repair order. Once they’ve done the repair works the repair shop can mark the order as completed. Afterwards, the insurance company will get a message to proceed the payment to the repair shop. a block is being written to the chain</p>

<p>The insurance company has the option to activate or deactivate certain contracts. This does not mean that contracts that have already been signed by customers will be no longer valid. It just does not allow new signings for these types of contracts. In addition, the insurance company has the possibility to create new contract templates that have different terms and conditions and a different pricing.  Any transaction will result in a block being written to the chain.</p>
